                <ul>

                    <p>The Department of Orthopaedics currently headed by Dr. A B Goregaonkar was established in 1970 under the leadership of Dr. Katrak. Initially, it started off with fifty beds and has since then progressed to become one of the premier centers for Orthopaedic surgery, not only in the city of Mumbai, but also in the entire country.




                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The Department was actively involved in setting up the trauma service in 1984, the first of its kind anywhere in India. The Department became one of the first teaching hospitals in the country equipped with A.O. instrumentation and from 1990 was also selected as one among the handful of trauma centers worldwide to conduct clinical trials for new implants and External fixators.





                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Under the leadership of Dr. N S Laud, who headed the Department from 1989 to 1995, the Department gained international recognition as a trauma referral service.


                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The trauma service better known as "E" ward. Provides comprehensive and prompt medical attention to all trauma victims without charge. Over time, this has now expanded to a round the clock Emergency Medical Services (EMS), providing immediate care to all patients with emergency conditions.




                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p>The Department is also actively involved in providing basic trauma life support training "Ayushyadan" to paramedical personnel and service personnel including the Mumbai police and the Maharashtra Highway Police.


                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The Department is in the forefront of organized teaching programs and besides a superbly structured undergraduate and postgraduate teaching program, also conducts hands on workshops and seminars on techniques of internal fixation. The annual Fracture Fixation Course has gone from strength to strength and has international delegates registering


                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>We have total bed strength of 155. We run two Operation OT's six days a week plus one emergency OT round the clock. The Orthopedic outpatient department sees on average 275 patients a day, 6 days a week.


                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>We also run follow up OPD which runs from Monday to Thursday, 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm., where we see patients which have been already examined once. This helps to segregate work load and giving proper care to patients.

                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Recently we have renovated major orthopedic O.T. This has laminar flow system which circulates clean air in operation theatre and helps in enhancing sterility of operation theatre.
